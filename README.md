# LangChain Knowledge Base Chatbot

This project is a **LangChain-powered chatbot** designed to answer user queries using a customizable knowledge base. Users can interact with the chatbot via a web interface, upload or type new knowledge bases, and experience memory-enabled conversational capabilities.
___

**Cohere** was selected for its **workable rate limits**, **smooth integration with LangChain** and **minimal error rates** (as discussed [here](https://medium.com/@lars.chr.wiik/best-embedding-model-openai-cohere-google-e5-bge-931bfa1962dc)).

In contrast:
- **OpenAI** no longer provides free trials for experimentation.
- **Hugging Face** has unresolved compatibility issues with LangChainâ€™s embedding functionalities.

## **Features**

### **1. Knowledge Base Management**
- View and edit the current knowledge base (default or user-provided).
- Options to upload a `.txt` file or type a new knowledge base.

### **2. AI Chatbot**
- Provides real-time answers by retrieving context from the knowledge base.
- Retains conversation history for contextual and personalized interactions using LangChain's memory system.

### **3. Testing with Jupyter Notebook**
- The `cohere_chatbot.ipynb` notebook provides a controlled environment for testing:
  - Validate the chatbot's ability to answer queries using a knowledge base.
  - Compare the behavior of a memory-enabled chatbot versus a non-memory chatbot.
  - Experiment with LangChain components like embeddings and FAISS.

### **4. Responsive Web Interface**
- Built with **Flask** for backend and **Bootstrap** for modern, responsive design.
